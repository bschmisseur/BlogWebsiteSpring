# BlogWebsiteSpring

For this project the objective was to create a website to have the ability to perform CRUD actions on. My partner and I decided to do a blog application where the user could create, read, update, and detroy the blogs. To implement this applcaition we started with using java as the base language and then leveraged the Spring Framework to be able to utilize the featrues it provided for java web development.
